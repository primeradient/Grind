**Permutations**
Arrange a given set of elements in a particular order. Here the sequence of arrangement is important. 

Example:
(p, q, r) can be arranged like 

(p, q, r),

(p, r, q), 

(q, p, r),

(q, r, p),

(r, p, q),  

(r, q, p). 

Only these six arrangements are possible. i.e. only these six permutations are possible.


Formula: **n! / (n – r)!**

where: ‘n’ elements are given, out of which we want to arrange ‘r’ elements


----------------------------------------------------------------

**Combination**
Selection of some elements from a given set of elements. Here the order in which the elements are selected is not important.

Example, 
->  the selection of 11 players from a wide number of players for a cricket team comes under combination 
->  which player will bat first, which will bat second, and so on, this arrangement of players comes under permutation.

**Formula:**  n! / r!(n – r)!

where: ‘n’ elements out of which we want to select ‘r’ elements
